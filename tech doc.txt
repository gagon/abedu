3. Under each grade title, subject cards are displayed left to right in the order: Math, Literacy, Science, English Language.
4. Clicks on a subject card (e.g., Grade 2 → Math) → lands on subject page with chapter list on left, placeholder video/text in middle, blank right panel.

8. Placeholder Content
* For now, chapters, text, and quizzes are placeholders.
* Use mock JSON data for grades, subjects, chapters.
